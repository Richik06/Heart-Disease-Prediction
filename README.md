# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Predicts whether a person has heart disease or not based on various heath attributes present in the dataset.
## Approach
- Problem defination
- Data Evaluation
- Features
- Modelling
- Experimentation
## Algorithms
Three algorithms RandomForestClassifier, KNeighboursClassifier and Logistic Regression is being used and the algorithm with best accuracy score on the model which is Logistic Regression is taken. Even after hyperparameter tuning on all the three algorithms , Logistic Regression was outperforming.
## Evaluation
Evaluating our tuned machhine learning classifier, beyond accuracy

- ROC curve and AUC scores
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
